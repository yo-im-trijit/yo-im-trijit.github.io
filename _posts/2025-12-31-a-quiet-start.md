Today I finally made this blog with Github.I had a lot of fun setting this up after new year. I really like making this because it is fun and cool for me. Today my dad was working on his laptop while i was doing this and my mom is sleeping right now. It is currently 12:45 pm

It’s simple.
It’s quiet.
And that’s exactly what I wanted.

### Why I’m writing
I want a place to slow down and think.
Somewhere I can write without trying to impress anyone.

Even short entries count.

> Consistency matters more than perfection.

That’s all for today.
