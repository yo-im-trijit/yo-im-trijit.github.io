Today I finally made this blog with github.I had a lot of fun setting this up after new year.

It’s simple.
It’s quiet.
And that’s exactly what I wanted.

### Why I’m writing
I want a place to slow down and think.
Somewhere I can write without trying to impress anyone.

Even short entries count.

> Consistency matters more than perfection.

That’s all for today.
